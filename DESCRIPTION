Authors@R: c(person(given = "Nicolas",
                    family = "Bennett",
                    role = c("aut", "cre"),
                    email = "nicolas.bennett@stat.math.ethz.ch"),

Description: Intended for larger-than-memory tabular data, prt objects provide an interface to read row and/or column subsets into memory as data.tables objects. Data queries, constructed as R experssions, are evaluated using the NSE framework provided by rlang and file-backing is powered by the fast and efficient fst package.
