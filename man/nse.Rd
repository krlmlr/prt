\usage{
\method{subset}{prt}(x, subset, select, part_safe = FALSE, drop = FALSE, ...)

subset_quo(
  x,
  subset = NULL,
  select = NULL,
  part_safe = FALSE,
  env = parent.frame()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object to be subsetted.}

\item{subset}{logical expression indicating elements or rows to keep:
    missing values are taken as false.}

\item{select}{expression, indicating columns to select from a
    data frame.}

\item{part_safe}{Logical flag indicating whether the \code{subset} expression
can be safely be applied to individual partitions.}

\item{drop}{passed on to \code{[} indexing operator.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.}

\item{env}{The environment in which \code{subset} and \code{select} are evaluated in.
This environment is not applicable for quosures because they have their own
environments.}
}
\description{
A cornerstone feature of \code{prt} is the ability to load a (small) subset of
rows (or columns) from a much larger tabular dataset. In order to specify
such a subset, an implementation of the base R S3 generic function
\code{subset()} is provided, driving the non-standard evaluation (NSE) of an
expression within the context of the data (with similar semantics as the
base R implementation for \code{data.frame}s).
}
\details{
The functions powering NSE are \code{rlang::enquo()} which quote the \code{subset} and
\code{select} arguments and \code{rlang::eval_tidy()} which evaluates the
expressions. This allows for some
\href{https://rlang.r-lib.org}{\code{rlang}}-specific features to be used, such as the
\code{.data}/\code{.env} pronouns, or the double-curly brace forwarding operator. For
some example code, please refer to
\href{../doc/prt.html}{\code{vignette("prt", package = "prt")}}.

While the function \code{subset()} quotes the arguments passed as \code{subset} and
\code{select}, the function \code{subset_quo()} can be used to operate on already
quoted expressions. A final noteworthy departure from the base R interface
is the \code{part_safe} argument: this logical flag indicates whether it is safe
to evaluate the expression on partitions individually or whether
dependencies between partitions prevent this from yielding correct results.
As it is not straightforward to determine if dependencies might exists from
the expression alone, the default is \code{FALSE}, which in many cases will
result in a less efficient resolution of the row-selection and it is up to
the user to enable this optimization.
